## Introduction
We used the datasets provided by the WPRDC, we determined the following metrics to measure the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh:
- Poverty rate
- Employment rate
- Property values

The poverty rate would be a reflection of many things in a neighborhood, like public funding. The employment rate is important because no one wants a long commute to work, so if a neighborhood had high employment rates, then there are jobs nearby. Property values were included because it represents the overall living conditions/neighbors based off of financial status.  


## Metric

We defined the best neighborhood as the neighborhood with a best economic that repeated in these three analysis.

Which is the neighborhood have **lowest poverty rate**, **highest employment rate** and **highest property value**

## Guangrui Wang's Conclusion

After the analysis, I find Northview Heights has the highest poverty rate. Since I am not originally from Pittsburgh. I don't have much experience with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods. So, I searched for information about Northview Heights and other neighborhoods. The best neighborhood in my research is Swisshelm Park, which has the lowest poverty rate. I searched for houses on sale on Zillow. I found that Swisshelm Park has six houses on sale with the price interval from $650,000 to $209,000. But, Northview Heights have zero houses on sale. This made me think about why this happened. Then I searched Northview Heights on wiki. I found that nearly all (96.3%) of the occupied units were rental housing in Northview Heights area. That approved my analysis. With the highest poverty rate, people cannot afford to buy a house, So people choose to rent. I believe that the neighborhood with a high poverty rate, and people mostly don't own their own house property. People won't be happy to live in a place like this. Looking back to Swisshelm Park, Swisshelm Park has the lowest poverty rate and rich entertainment facilities. I think people will be more likely to choose to live in **Swisshelm Park**.

## Jenny Lee's Conclusion
Excluding the business districts, the best neighborhood was **Fairywood**. Guangrui's best neighborhood was Swisshelm Park, which was #36 based on my metric. Seonmin's best neighborhood was North Fayette, which was not within the dataset I chose. Employment rate can vary by many factors, but generalizing for the purposes of this project, employment rate can mean oppurtunities. Oppurtunities to advance a career, start a new one, and a place with high employment rates almost always enjoy higher quality amneities.

## Seon Min Cho's Conclusion
Based on the results of my analysis, **North Fayette** is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh as they have the highest average property value based on property sales made from years 2012 to 2020. Property values explicitly represent the monetary worth of properties and can also reflect on the quality of life of the said property as the value directly correlates with demand. 

## Best Overall Neighborhood
**North Shore** is the best overall neighborhood. By looking at our individual findings, we found the best neighborhood that we had in common.
