## Introduction
We used the datasets provided by the WPRDC, we determined the following metrics to measure the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh:
- Poverty rate
- Employment rate
- Property values

The poverty rate would be a reflection of many things in a neighborhood, like public funding. The employment rate is important because no one wants a long commute to work, so if a neighborhood had high employment rates, then there are jobs nearby. Property values were included because it represents the overall living conditions/neighbors based off of financial status.  


## Metric



## Guangrui Wang's Conclusion

After the analysis, I find Northview Heights has the highest poverty rate. Since I am not originally from Pittsburgh. I don't have much experience with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods. So, I searched for information about Northview Heights and other neighborhoods. The best neighborhood in my research is Swisshelm Park, which has the lowest poverty rate. I searched for houses on sale on Zillow. I found that Swisshelm Park has six houses on sale with the price interval from $650,000 to $209,000. But, Northview Heights have zero houses on sale. This made me think about why this happened. Then I searched Northview Heights on wiki. I found that nearly all (96.3%) of the occupied units were rental housing in Northview Heights area. That approved my analysis. With the highest poverty rate, people cannot afford to buy a house, So people choose to rent. I believe that the neighborhood with a high poverty rate, and people mostly don't own their own house property. People won't be happy to live in a place like this. Looking back to Swisshelm Park, Swisshelm Park has the lowest poverty rate and rich entertainment facilities. I think people will be more likely to choose to live in Swisshelm Park.
